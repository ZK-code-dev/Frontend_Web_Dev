# 🌐 My Frontend Web Development Projects 💻

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to my **frontend web development portfolio**. I’ve been diving into how websites are made and experimenting with different languages like **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## 💻🌐💡Learning Journey

I really enjoyed seeing how websites are built and learning the different languages used to make them interactive and visually appealing!

A big shoutout to **Shaun from [The Net Ninja YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TheNetNinja)** — following along with his tutorials has helped me understand how to apply new skills to build a simple website from scratch. 🎉

I’ve also started practicing with **[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)** challenges and I’m excited to take on more projects after completing their first course, which includes learning **Git and GitHub**.

Plus, I’ve been learning a lot from other YouTube tutorials and experimenting with my own ideas. 🚀

## 🌟 Current Projects

- **Simple Mario website** built using HTML and CSS.
- Future projects: more Frontend Mentor challenges, usage of java (to make sites more interactive), interactive web apps, and personal portfolio projects .
